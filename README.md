    * Create a file named books.json.
    
    * You are going to populate the file with data about books. Have at least 6

    Create JSON objects for the books. Make sure your JSON string is valid by Parsing
    it through this site.

###### Compulsory Task 2

Follow these instructions:

    * Create a python program called taskXML.py. Write the code to:
        
        * Read in the movie.xml file.
        
        * Read about the iter() and itertext() function here. Use the iter() function
        to list all the child tags of the movie element.

        * Use the itertext() function to print out the movie descriptions.

        * Find the number of movies that are favourites and the number of movies that
